## Explanation
Compression technology that compresses high-frequency bytes.

## Usage
### compression
```
./compression.exe <your file path>
```

Compressed file "archive.sac" will be generated.

### decompression
```
./compression.exe <your file path>
```

The compressed file will be decompressed to the original file.

## To be improved
1. Works better on txt files and code files.
2. Need to expand the scope to increase the extraction of high-frequency bytes.
